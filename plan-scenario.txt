Basic scenario operation:
  Add scenarios to a model by creating ScenarioDir and adding ScenarioConfig file to it
    Helper functions to initialize ScenarioConfig
    Get list of input files to use in constructing categories and levels
  Need to set:
    StartFrom stage in base model (default is last Reportable, can provide non-character to ignore)
    ScenarioDir (where to look for scenario configuration, inputs)
  If ScenarioDir (default="scenarios" relative to ModelDir) exists:
    - Look for ScenarioConfig defaulting to "scenarios.cnf";
    - If ScenarioDir contains scenarios.cnf, that file will be opened and the keys "Categories" (optional)
      and "Scenarios" will be sought in it.
  The Scenarios key contains:
    StartFrom (the stage that the scenarios will start from; must be Reportable)
      - May be NULL (scenarios are free-standing runnable model stages)
      - Even without StartFrom, InputPath for Scenarios will still include InputPath
        for Model if the model has an InputPath
      - So the scenarios can still just have the subset of inputs that are different
    ModelStages (definitions of ModelStages)
      - These can be constructed manually, built (loading available directories, or built
        from Category/Level configuration)
      - Reportable will be ignored (always TRUE)
      - StartFrom can be specified (or NULL) for each ModelStage
      - Any settings for the stage Config are always inline for Category-Level Scenarios
      - Free-standing scenarios from directories can have a visioneval.cnf, which is read
        just as for standard model stages
  The Categories key (if present) contains:
    A list of Categories (by Key)
      with Name, Description
    Within each category:
      Levels
        List of Levels (by Key) with Name, Description
      Files
        List of input files (name only) to be changed for this Category
        Each level for the category gets those files (from StartFrom stage)

TODO: keep track of whether the scenarios are explicit (implemented as model stages) or
  categories. Changes how $files works and what happens when we $build (and whether we
  can $add a scenario).
TODO: develop VEModelScenario$add function to add a manual scenario; creates a folder
  and drops visioneval.cnf into it (with InputPath set) pivoting off BaseModel/StartFrom.
TODO: add nuance to "files" function; if we're doing manual scenarios, then we need
  to add a Files key to visioneval.cnf for the manual scenario - those will be copied
  if present when we build the scenario (but unchanged if they already exist - eventually
  compare the files to the BaseModel/InputPath version).
  Files key in visioneval.cnf will be loaded and saved.
  If the Files key exists, those are the "scenario files" - so the files function
    should have a flag to indicate what category or scenario we're getting the files
    for (and which levels have files, and which are different from each other and the
    BaseModel/StartFrom stage).

Create a VEScenarioCategory class?
  Would manage a Category plus its levels and files.
  Has a Name, a list of Levels, and a list of Files
  Could just be a list (need not be an R6 class)
  But it would be nice to have member functions:
    View/Set Levels
      No args: show list
      Name: retrieve element
      Name, Description: set or replace Description
      LevelDir: derived from Name if not set explicitly (for InputPath)
    Add/Remove Files
      ListFiles: show files (list of names)
      AddFiles: list of files to add to Category
      RemoveFiles: list of files to remove from Category
  Copying files to the Levels is done in VEModelScenarios$build

[DONE] The model's "$scenarios" function returns a VEModelScenarios object
  Pointer to the BaseModel
  StartFrom stage
  ScenarioDir (relative to model$modelPath, snapshot of BaseModel$setting("ScenarioDir"))
    NULL if ScenarioDir does not exist
  ScenarioConfig (snapshot of BaseModel$setting("ScenarioConfig") name)
    NULL if ScenarioConfig does not exist
  Option to create ScenarioDir and blank ScenarioConfig (create=TRUE)
  Option to force reload (fromFile) or skip file reload
Printing the scenarios object will say if scenarios are defined.
  [DONE] VEModelScenarios$initialize(BaseModel,create=FALSE,startFrom=NULL)
    BaseModel is required (search for ScenarioDir)
    Populate the scenario structure
      BaseModel, StartFrom, ScenarioDir, ScenarioConfig (nail it down at the moment of creation)
    If create==TRUE, build ScenarioDir and add ScenarioConfig
      Pull startFrom from BaseModel if create==TRUE and not provided (last Reportable stage)
    If create==FALSE, just consider what is (not) there
    Does $load if ScenarioDir exists or got created (ScenarioConfig may or may not exist)
  [DONE] VEModelScenarios$load(StartFrom=NULL,build=TRUE,scenarioPath=NULL)
    Option to (re)set "StartFrom" if provided (forces build to TRUE)
    Will load "scenarios.cnf" if it exists in ScenarioDir and extract "Scenarios" key
    If "Scenarios" key does not exist, create it and resave scenarios.cnf
      Contains ScenarioDir, StartFrom (may be reset during loading)
    Use Categories key if present, but don't build/create automatically
    Can optionally specify "build" to try constructing ModelStages
      Model stages will be rebuilt from what is in scenarios.cnf in this case
      If $build fails, report what is missing
      If $build succeeds, replace ModelStages
    Otherwise note in print/status that ModelStages have not been built
    If build==TRUE, also rewrite ScenarioDir/ScenarioConfig with any built changes.
  [DONE] VEModelScenarios$save()
    Save the in-memory scenario configuration back to ScenarioDir/ScenarioConfig
    Use as an alternative (and perhaps call from within) to the Save=TRUE option on $load, $files, $build
  [DONE] VEModelScenarios$stages()
    Return the built list of stages (or an empty list)
  VEModelScenarios$print()
    Indicate type of scenarios (manual, category-based)
    Indicate how many scenarios are defined
    If manual, list the scenarios
    If category-based report Category/Level/File, plus the number of generated scenarios
  VEModelScenarios$inputs(scenario or category name; default all of them)
    Return StartFrom inputs that have been defined in the requested (default: ALL) scenario or categories
    Option to show all files (default for full scenario - looks at BaseModel/StartFrom inputs)
      or just those defined in the scenario/category (looks at files named in the category)
      For categories, will say if the file belongs to the category (perhaps also report levels in which the file actually exists)
      For scenarios, will say if the file exists in the scenario directory
    Validate category inputs - file can only occur in one category
    For directory based scenarios
  VEModelScenarios$fromCSV(CSVFile,overwrite=FALSE) # implies Save==TRUE
    # Simpler function just to parse CSV files set up the "old way" (see VEScenario)
    If CSVFile is provided (TRUE = "scenario_categories.csv", or an alternate name):
      Read that file to determine categories to attach to the Input files
      Flag any inputs in the CSV that are not in the StartFrom Stage
      Return the Category_df from the CSV file
      If Save is true and Category_df is provided, save Category_df to CSVFile
    Don't change anything if the CSV does not have a valid configuration
    Only replace an existing configuration if the scenarios have nto yet been built
  VEModelScenarios$build(Source=NULL,FileNames=NULL,Reset=FALSE,Save=TRUE)
    Main activity of "build" is to construct ModelStages from the scenarios identified in scenario.cnf
    If Save==TRUE
    Save = TRUE/FALSE; if TRUE, rewrite scenaros.cnf, if FALSE, rebuild ModelStages and change only in memory
    Source = "folders" or "directories":'
      FileNames, if present, is a vector of directories to make into scenario stages
        if not present, all sub-directories are made into stages
      Each designated sub-directory is made into a model stage (like any sub-directory)
        Can perhaps abstract the same code used in VEModel$configure
      Populate the Scenarios structure (for scenarios.cnf)
      ModelStages will be just use the sub-directories as "StageDir" for the stages
      If the sub-directory has a visioneval.cnf, set StageConfig instead
      Names of sub-directories will be Names of scenario stages (must be unique relative to Model)
      Categories structure will not exist and we don't create it
      But we do create the ModelStages structure
      Then we're done
    Source = "tables" -- DO NOT DO THIS: force the "config" option?
      FileNames, if present, is a vector of c("scenario-categories.csv","scenario-levels.csv")
      Read FileName2[1]=scenario-categories.csv - a table of input files allocated to categories
        Can use a file created by VEModelScenarios$files
        Table has File, Category, Description
      Read FileNames[2] scenario-levels.csv - a table of category levels
        Table has Category, Level, Description
        Read those into the Categories structure
        Stop with error if the file does not exist or if it contains non-existent categories or
          fails to contain levels for each defined category
      Construct the Categories key in the scenarios configuration
      Proceed to complete the "config" process below below
    Source = "config":
      Use the Categories structure from scenarios.cnf that has these elements:
        Categories
          Files
            Must be inputs to StartFrom stage, must be unique across all Categories)
          Levels
            Sub-Folder for each Category-Level must exist
      Proceed to complete the Category build (below)
    Complete the Category build: After doing table or config build setup, complete as follows:
      Build a Categories/Files/Levels structure (using either tables or what is in scenario.cnf)
      Validate categories:
        Each category must have at least one additional level
          StartFrom is the implied base scenario for all
        Each category must specify at least one file
        Each file from StartFrom input must exist in at most one category
      Create any Category-Level folders that do not exist
        Make folders for each Category
          Make folders for each Level
      Install the Category files from StartFrom InputPath into each Level folder
        If the file is present, just skip it
        If a file not in the Category is present in a level, warn the user and stop the build
        If a file is not present, copy it from the StartFrom InputPath
      Build the ModelStages structure:
        Make a Scenarios/ModelStage entry for each combination of Category-Level
        Name constructed from index of Category and Level (C1L2C2L3)
          The stages are just the scenarios
          The StartFrom stage corresponds to C1L0C2L0 but is not identifed that way
        Set up InputPath (vector of Category-Level folders), Scenario, Description, ScenarioDir (for output)
          # The ModelStages structure placed in the Model's Scenarios key:
          # Should end up defining for each scenario (ModelStage):
          #   Name (of stage; defaults to basename(Dir) )
          #   Dir (compound name for stage, for ResultsDir; or folder if scenario is folder-based )
          #   Scenario (or Name or basename(Dir)) - used for Query column headings
          #   Description (Category + Level Descriptions): could end up REALLY long...
          #   InputPath (compounded as path to CategoryLevel subdirectories relative to
          #     BaeModel$modelPath/ScenarioDir) - should normalize when Scenario stages are loaded.
          #   Reportable (always TRUE)
          #   Additional configuration can be provided by hand for Category scenarios
          #   Manual scenarios can be adjusted through their own visioneval.cnf
        Goes straight into ModelStages (rewrite ModelStages structure)
    If Save or no scenarios.cnf, write resulting Scenarios, Categories and ModelStages tags into scenarios.cnf
    If not Save, then just keep the scenario object up to date (can call VEModelScenarios$save)

============================

  Scenario stages are appended after the last regular ModelStage (note that the scenarios are
  automatically considered Reportable, and we don't alter Reportable for any "StartFrom" stage).
  Also require unique names for the scenarios. If scenario configuration is broken, just do a
  warning. Warn if model has no scenarios at all.

  Helper functions for VEModelScenario. Figure out how to interact these with the "build"
    function: probably these should just help make templates.
  VEModelScenarios$categories()
    # Report if using directory-based (manual) scenarios
      # Each scenario folder is a "Category"
    # If category-based:
      # Report the Categories key from Scenarios key, if present, else "No categories defined"
  VEModelScenarios$list()
    # Reports the ModelStages (Scenario names, possibly with Description)
    # Works for both category-based and manual scenarios
    # Or should it report a vector of VEModelStages - the latter is more flexible
    #   and could support the internal operation of creating the group of scenarios
    #   to run.
    # Picking a "stage" for producing a directory or finding out about it should look
    #   not just into the model's intrinsic ModelStages but also into the Scenarios$ModelStages

  In the VEModel print function, we need to distinguish scenario model stages from those that
    are intrinsic to the base model. We can do that by factoring out ModelStages whose names
    are present/not present in the scenario list
