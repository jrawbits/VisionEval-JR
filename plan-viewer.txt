The VisionEval viewer is built on three interrelated Javascript libraries:

Javascript => is an operator for creating a lambda function (without its own "this"):

"s => s.length" is results-wise the same as "function(s){ return s.length }"

D3-JS (https://d3js.org)

D3 allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM),
and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. For
example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of
numbers. Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart
with smooth transitions and interaction.

Readers familiar with other DOM frameworks such as jQuery should
immediately recognize similarities with D3. Yet styles, attributes,
and other properties can be specified as functions of data in D3, not
just simple constants. Despite their apparent simplicity, these
functions can be surprisingly powerful; the d3.geoPath function, for
example, projects geographic coordinates into SVG path data. D3
provides many built-in reusable functions and function factories, such
as graphical primitives for area, line and pie charts.

Crossfilter.js (http://crossfilter.github.io/crossfilter/)

Crossfilter is a JavaScript library for exploring large multivariate
datasets in the browser. Crossfilter supports extremely fast (<30ms)
interaction with coordinated views, even with datasets containing a
million or more records.

The coordinated visualizations below (built with D3)...

dc.js (https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/)

dc.js is a javascript charting library with native crossfilter
support, allowing highly efficient exploration on large
multi-dimensional datasets (inspired by crossfilter's demo). It
leverages d3 to render charts in CSS-friendly SVG format. Charts
rendered using dc.js are data driven and reactive and therefore
provide instant feedback to user interaction.
