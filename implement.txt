User selects how to collapse Group/Year + Scenario within the same Table
Generates ExportTable names associated with each combination of Scenario, Group-Year, Table
  May repeat the same table name (it's a lookup)
Walk through each result set (AllSpecs_ls) and generate rows of Scenario/Group-Year/Table/Field metadata for each ExportTable
  Scenario is a metadata field always, for all Tables
  Group-Year is a metadata field always, for all Tables
  Then we just add in the additional Scenario/Group-Year/Table/Field

Do that by iterating over all Scenarios and within them all Groups/Years/Fields
  Visit the Specs and add all the Fields, with ExportTable looked up based on Scenario/Group-Year/Table
  That creates one Metadata table that can optional be saved to the database.

Iterate over the Scenarios, using Metadata to:
  Identify the corresponding Export Table (look up by Scenario / Group-Year / Table)
  Create the ExportTable with necessary Fields (if not already there)
  Pull out data.frame for Group-Year/Table from the Scenario Datastore (Scenario is a field)
  Write the data.frame to the ExportTable (append rows)

And that should do it!

For the export format, need to have these operations:
  Set "database" (place to write tables)
  Create an ExportTable with its name and Fields (from Metadata)
  Write a set of rows with compatible fields to the ExportTable

Then we just need to figure out how to realize it.
Parquet is neat since we can have individual tables but also have them viewable as a single unit.
