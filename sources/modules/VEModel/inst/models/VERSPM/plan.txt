Embrace a variety of configurations for VERSPM that can be used as samples.

Basic model - classic content repackaged in modern model form (single stage)

Model staged by Year (vertical): one stage does the base year, the other does the future year

Model staged by Script (horizontal): run the population synthesis pieces,
then do the later steps in a different stage - those later steps are vertically staged, so
the model does the base year, then does a separate future year stage. The population
synthesis includes both years.
