Notes:
  - Some static scenarios implemented as ModelStages
  - Stage directory goes onto the InputPath
  - Dir element of each stage is optional (if directory has name of stage)
  - Better to make explicit in order to document that input files are being changed
  - If stage has no Dir and Dir does not exist, it's no error and stage gets only the StartFrom inputs

StartFrom: "stage-pop-future"       # StartFrom stage for ModelStages (adjust for your model)

ModelStages:
  "Design-1":
     # Inherit year, base year, etc plus the model scripts from stage-pop-future
