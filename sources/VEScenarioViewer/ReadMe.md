## VEScenarioViewer

This deprecated directory provides sample runs for the old VisionEval scenario viewer using outputs
built from the VEScenario package. The viewer requires manual adjustment if different scenario
combinations or performance metrics are desired. A generalized integration with VisionEval 3.0
("Next Generation") is under development, based on the VEModel package and the VEQuery R6 object
defined there. Once a query has been run across a set of scenarios, the query results may be
visualized by providing a specification file that categorizes the scenarios (the histograms at the
top) and that identifies the metrics in the query output that should be displayed in the bottom
section.
