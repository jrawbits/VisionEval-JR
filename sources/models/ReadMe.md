## Models directory

This directory is deprecated and it no longer appears in the built version of VisionEval. Starting
with VisionEval Version 3.0 ("Next Generation"), standard model variations are built into the
VEModel package. To access them, build or install VisionEval and then load the VEModel package to
start the runtime environment. Use the installModel function to select one of the standard models
and install it along with representative stample data.

The scenario functionality is incorporated in VEModel (so the previous VEScenario package is also
deprecated).
